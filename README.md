    A Mobile-First user interface built on React that allows a user to view a list of users from a mock JSON. On clicking on any user, a modal displays all the time ranges during which they were active on a particular day selected by the user through a calendar. GUI also provides a deeper insight just through hovering over the users, with a graph which plots the duration of sessions of seven most recent days.
    I have also added a JSON editor to edit and update the hardcoded JSON. Comes out of box with a complex JSON with many users to better test the UI.
